I'll create a more comprehensive solution that implements the advanced chunking strategy we discussed, leveraging LangChain for handling the vectorization part. This solution will process the entire Python documentation structure and apply sophisticated chunking techniques.

I've created a comprehensive solution for processing Python documentation into chunks optimized for RAG systems. This implementation takes into account all the aspects we discussed earlier and adds several advanced features.

## Key Features of the Implementation

### Hierarchical Context Preservation

The chunker preserves the hierarchical structure of the documentation by:
- Maintaining the file path information
- Creating a section path array that tracks heading hierarchy
- Preserving the relationship between sections and subsections
- Creating special module index documents that serve as navigation guides

### Content-Aware Chunking

The implementation uses different chunking strategies based on content type:
- Special handling for code examples and tables, keeping them intact
- Different chunk sizes for different content types (API reference vs. tutorials)
- Preservation of critical structural elements

### Rich Metadata

Each chunk is enriched with detailed metadata:
- Module categorization
- Deprecation status 
- Content type classification (explanation, API reference, tutorial, example)
- Related modules detection
- Python version information

### Special Structure Handling

The chunker provides special handling for:
- Code blocks (detected by indentation or `>>>` prompts)
- Tables (preserved intact)
- Section hierarchies (main sections and subsections)
- Module index documents for better navigation

### Vectorization Support

The solution integrates with LangChain for:
- Converting chunks to LangChain Document objects
- Creating embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model
- Storing in a Chroma vector database for retrieval

## Using the Code

To use this chunker:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install langchain langchain-openai chromadb
   ```

2. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. Run the script on your Python documentation directory:
   ```bash
   python chunker.py /path/to/python-3.13-docs-text --output ./python_docs_vectorstore
   ```

## Implementing RAG Query

After building the vector store, you can create a RAG application to query it:

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize the LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo")

# Create a retriever from the vectorstore
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity",
    search_kwargs={"k": 5}
)

# Create the conversational chain
qa_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True
)

# Query the system
query = "How do I set up logging to a file in Python?"
result = qa_chain({"question": query, "chat_history": []})
print(result["answer"])
```

## Advanced Features

The implementation includes several advanced features:

1. **Module Relationship Detection**: The code attempts to detect references to other modules to build a web of relationships.

2. **Content Type Classification**: The chunker automatically classifies content as API reference, examples, tutorials, or explanations.

3. **Special Index Documents**: The system creates special navigation documents that help understand the structure of modules.

4. **Dynamic Chunk Sizing**: Chunk sizes are adjusted based on content type to balance detail and context.

5. **Metadata Enrichment**: Each chunk is enriched with metadata that helps provide context during retrieval.

This solution provides a solid foundation that you can further customize based on specific requirements for your Python documentation RAG system.
